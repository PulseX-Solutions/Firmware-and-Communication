Arduino / NRF / Other microcontroller sketches

Detected examples:
- `NRF/` — contains `ARD_Rec`, `ARD_Tx`, `send`, `sendreceive` sketches (nRF24L01 or similar)
- `day1/` — multiple Arduino/ESP demos (Blink, BT_sender, dht_sensor, etc.)

Notes

- Treat these as reference examples. If your main focus is ESP32/ESP8266 communication with a Raspberry Pi, move only the relevant sketches into `firmware/` and keep older Arduino experiments under `arduino_examples/` or `legacy/`.
- Add a short header to each directory with instructions for building/uploading and required wiring/pinouts.
